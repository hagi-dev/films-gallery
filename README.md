## Problem

You have been tasked with developing a web application that connects to and consumes data from a JSON file (an example of this JSON is included in the appendix of this document). The file provides information about movies: Name, description, and their genre classification. Your goal is to create a user interface that displays a list of movies and allows for the following operations:"

<ol>
  <li>Filter movies by name</li>
  <li>Filter movies by description</li>
  <li>Filter movies by genre</li>  
</ol>


## Tech Stack

<ol>
  <li>Angular 16 </li>
